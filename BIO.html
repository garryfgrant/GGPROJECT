<h2><i> Garry Grant (b. 1971) is a visual artist based in New York City.</i></h2
>
<p>Grant is a multi-media abstract artist, whose work is inspired by the materials he employs and the use of color and texture.  A master gilder, he uses gold, silver and copper leaf for the underpinning of his large-scale works, building these variegated metals onto the canvas to create vibrancy and varying degrees of depth to the background. He often adds pressure to the canvas to bring about a cracked-pattern effect, adding a rich texture to the composition.  For the foreground, he applies acrylic paint and other pigments to the canvas by hand, manipulating the material until attenuated forms cover the surface. </p>g
 
<p>The tone of Grant's work conveys a sense of rhythm; the forms expressive movement.  Grant recently expanded his artistic practice to include life size human figures.   In April 2015, several of these figures were featured in the multi-disciplinary Ulysses in 3: Variations on Ulysses through Word, Movement, and Music, presented at Park Avenue Armory in New York City.  In 2014, Grant was one of 250 artists, designers, and architects selected to participate in The Faberg'e Big Egg Hunt, a public art installation and benefit auction in New York City.  His Detroit Industrial Complex series commenced in 2012 and responds to the urban blight, decay and natural beauty of his hometown.</p>
